I analyzed an Uber rides dataset using Python to uncover trends and patterns in ride behavior. The project involved pandas ,data cleaning, exploration, and visualization using Matplotlib to better understand demand across different times and locations. 

This project helped strengthen my ability to turn raw data into meaningful insights.

Recently completed a data analysis project using an Uber dataset, where I explored ride patterns and visualized insights using Python and Matplotlib. I focused on cleaning the data, analyzing trends, and creating clear visualizations to tell a story with data.

This project was a great hands-on experience in data analytics and Python visualization.
